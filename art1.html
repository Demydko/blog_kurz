        The transition from page to screen is always exciting, but there's
        nothing quite like experiencing a story in its original form. Here are

        screen: Dune by Frank Herbert – A sci-fi epic that's as relevant today
        as when it was first published. Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens –
        A beautifully written mystery set in the swamps of North Carolina. The
        Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern – A magical tale of a traveling circus
        that appears only at night. The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt – A Pulitzer
        Prize-winning novel that explores art, loss, and identity. The Last
        Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave – A gripping thriller about family
        secrets and deception. Anatomy of a Scandal by Sarah Vaughan – A
        courtroom drama that delves into the lives of the elite. A Man Called
        Ove by Fredrik Backman – A heartwarming story about an irritable old man
        and his unlikely friendships. The Underground Railroad by Colson
        Whitehead – A powerful reimagining of history that won the Pulitzer
        Prize. Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir – From the author of The Martian,
        this sci-fi novel is full of twists and turns. The Ballad of Songbirds
        and Snakes by Suzanne Collins – A prequel to The Hunger Games that dives
        into the backstory of President Snow. Make sure to read these before the
        lights dim and the opening credits roll!
